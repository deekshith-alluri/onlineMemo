#online-memo-creation
this project is basically a web-development project by thought.
but it is ended up being attached to the dataBase, for we have had not enough budget i thought to using google's sheets product.
i made use of "appscript" and have created an endpoint to send the data.
and have used javascript to send the data towards the endpoint as a "javascript object"

basically, one can upload the data of the students and when the search is opened for MEMO-making and given a valid student ID, it grabs the relevant data from the dataBase such as: Name, ID, Father's Name, Cell no, Email, and Scores

let's see how it ends....
